<h1>EVGA iCX</h1>
<p>The patented EVGA iCX is comprised of two main components - EVGA iCX Cooling and EVGA iCX Technology. Select EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards are built using EVGA iCX Cooling, which delivers industry-leading cooling performance. To take full advantage of iCX Cooling, select EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards are built with iCX Technology to monitor temperatures and communicate dynamically with iCX Cooling to give you Peace of Mind Gaming.</P>
<h1>EVGA iCX Cooling</h1>
<p>EVGA iCX Cooling was built from the ground-up to reimagine how every area of a graphics card can improve cooling performance. iCX Cooling begins with a form-fitting die-cast baseplate and backplate, which touch all vital components and uses an interlaced pin fin design to remove more heat from components. The aerodynamically-designed heatsink contacts the baseplate in multiple areas, using a series of pin holes and half-open fins to direct air over the graphics card. EVGA GTX 1080 Ti graphics cards with iCX Cooling include a safety fuse to protect your card and system. iCX Cooling can be further controlled by using EVGA Precision XOC.</p>
<h1>EVGA iCX Technology</h1>
<p>EVGA iCX Technology takes iCX Cooling to a new level. iCX Technology incorporates 9 additional thermal sensors on the graphics card PCB, which monitor the GPU, the Power, and Memory areas of the graphics card. The iCX Technology monitoring is used to dynamically direct the fans asynchronously to allow iCX Cooling to increase airflow wherever it's needed most. iCX Technology further includes a safety fuse to protect your card and system. EVGA iCX Technology can be further monitored and controlled through EVGA Precision XOC to truly give you Peace of Mind Gaming!</p></div>
